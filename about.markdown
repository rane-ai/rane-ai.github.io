Musings on my journey navigating through the algorithmic complexities of 3D Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My blog is driven by a continual fascination by the creativity shown by the practitioners in these abstract spaces.

I aim to convey the key ideas of a topic/project in an accessible, somewhat informal and conversational manner. In doing so, I hope the reader can gain an understanding without having to negotiate the density of academic papers.
